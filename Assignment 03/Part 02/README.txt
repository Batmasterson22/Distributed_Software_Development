Jason R Hodges / CSE445 / Project 03 / Part 02

- I added two of the services to the existing service from project 01 named WeatherService but they are seperated with comments denoting which part it is. 

- The RESTful is seperate from the other services and it is called CreditCardService.

- The two xml files that are used for the data that is stored are located in the App_Data folder of the WeatherService WCF project folder.
